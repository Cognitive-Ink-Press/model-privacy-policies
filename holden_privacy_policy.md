## 1. No Personal Data Collection

Holden does not collect, store, or share any personal information about users. No identifying data is retained from your interactions. All queries and results are ephemeral and used only for the duration of your session.

---

## 2. Third-Party API Use

This GPT uses public APIs—such as CourtListener (Free Law Project)—to retrieve litigation records, dockets, and related legal data. These APIs are queried solely to fulfill user-initiated prompts. No query logs, identifiers, or API responses are stored by Holden or its maintainers.

---

## 3. No Advertising or Tracking

Holden does not use cookies, analytics tools, ad networks, or behavioral trackers. You are not profiled or targeted in any way. This tool is built for research and legal insight, not monetization.

---

## 4. Platform Context and Hosting

All interaction with Holden takes place within the OpenAI ChatGPT platform. As such, your use is also governed by [OpenAI’s Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy). Holden does not have access to or control over any information stored by OpenAI.

## 5. Updates and Contact

This policy may be revised as new features are added or if data practices change. The most recent version will always be available at:
